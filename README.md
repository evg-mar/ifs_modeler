Simulator for Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets.

In this repository a Python interactive implementation is proposed for modelling different operators for IFSs. 
Matplotlib is used for visualizations. 
We also propose different types of histograms for IFSs: 2D histograms, 3D histograms, etc.

Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are sets whose elements have degrees of membership and non-membership. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets have been introduced by Krassimir Atanassov (1983) as an extension of Lotfi Zadeh's notion of fuzzy set, which itself extends the classical notion of a set.
